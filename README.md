# MultiTemplateLoader
Thunderbird plugin. Forked from https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/templateloader-en.html (which seems it is not longer in development)

Made it some time ago to easen email sending and replying (it is useful to be able to create templates and use them with a few keystrokes). I can't remember the features, but it seems that I added the possibility of choosing from multiple templates, and also I seem to recall that I implemented shorcut keys.

**Extension is now working in Thunderbird 45.2.0**

# Documentation

(To be done)

You can select a default template for the identity under the "Tools" menu item. Also, be sure to add the "Templates" button to your compose message window toolbar, from there you will be able to configure and use the templates.

Templates should be in the form of html files. See the documentation for the original extension, either in the included file or the [web site of the original extension](https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/templateloader-en.html) to know more about the format and the allowed options (like attachments).

Also, shortcut keys in the from of Control + F-num keys are available from the compose message window.

# TO DO

- Improve the documentation.
